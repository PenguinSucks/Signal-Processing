# MATLAB Signal Operations

This project demonstrates various signal operations including scaling, reversing, and addition for both discrete and continuous signals using MATLAB.

## Contents

- **main.m**: The main script that runs the signal operations.
- **plotDiscreteSignal.m**: Function to plot discrete signals (if separated from `main.m`).
- **plotContinuousSignal.m**: Function to plot continuous signals (if separated from `main.m`).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `main.m` in MATLAB.
3. Run the script to visualize the different signal operations.

## Operations

- **Discrete Signal Operations**:
  - Time scaling (compression and expansion)
  - Signal reversing
  - Signal addition with zero padding

- **Continuous Signal Operations**:
  - Time scaling (compression and expansion)
  - Signal reversing
  - Signal addition with padding
